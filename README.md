# Packt Web Spider

A very simple web scraper to bring the title of the current day's free Ebook title to the command line.

## How to use
1. Download the `spider.js` file
2. `cd` into the directory containing the file
3. Run `node spider.js`

As simple as that!

## Why this???
Well, I am a physician with an extreme passion for coding, esp Javascript and Python. I made this out of interest in web scrappers. This does not use any dependencies.

### Ideas
- Store the script as a Alfred shortcut in mac and use it to run it.
- Automate the script on a server and
    - Mail yourself
    - Create a twitter bot that tweets out useful resources
    - Create a reminder with IFTTT
- Connect it to alexa and ask her for the title when you need it!
